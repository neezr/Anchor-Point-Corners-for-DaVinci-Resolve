## Usage:
- Execute this script from DaVinci Resolve's dropdown menu (Workspace > Scripts)
- Select a video clip on your Edit page and "pin" its Anchor Point to a corner or side of the screen with one of the buttons in the panel.
- Note: Keyframes are sadly not supported by this script, because they are not callable from the API

## Install:
- Copy the .lua-file into the folder "%appdata%\Blackmagic Design\DaVinci Resolve\Support\Fusion\Scripts\Edit"
